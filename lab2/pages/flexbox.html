        <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small
            to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what
            humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and
            yellow!</p>

                    <p>Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high
                        school.
                        Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
                        You
                        did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about
                        Frankie?
                        - Yeah. - You going to the funeral?</p>

            guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
            That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today
            we are men. - We are! - Bee-men.</p>
